                            <p>I attended Sekolah Kebangsaan Paya Rumput (SKK SK Paya Rumput), located in the historic state of Melaka, from 2011 to 2016. During my time there, I was proud to serve as a Pengawas Pembimbing Rakan Sebaya (Peer Guidance Prefect), a role that strengthened my leadership and communication skills. Known for its focus on Science and Rugby, the school provided a dynamic environment that encouraged both academic and co-curricular excellence. These formative years not only nurtured my curiosity in learning but also instilled values of teamwork and resilience, shaping the foundation of my personal growth.</p>

                            <p>I attended Sekolah Sains Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah Pekan (Shah Pekan), a prestigious Sekolah Berasrama Penuh (SBP), from 2017 to 2022. Renowned as one of the largest schools in Southeast Asia, Shah Pekan provided an exceptional environment for academic and personal development.

The school’s emphasis on discipline, leadership, and excellence challenged me to grow both as a student and an individual. My years at Shah Pekan were filled with valuable experiences that continue to inspire and shape my journey.</p>
